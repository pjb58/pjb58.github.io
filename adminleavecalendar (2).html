  <h1>Admin Leave Calendar Application</h1>
  <p>
    The Admin Leave Calendar application is designed to help managers easily view and manage staff leave schedules in a clear, visual format. The application displays employee leave details on a calendar-like grid, making it simple to see which employees are on leave on specific days.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Employee and Company Details:</strong> The calendar lists each employee along with their respective company information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Daily Leave Records:</strong> For each employee, the application shows leave entries for every workday. Each day is clearly marked with the date and day of the week.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Color-Coded Leave Types:</strong> Different types of leave (for example, annual leave, sick leave, etc.) are highlighted using distinct colors. This helps managers quickly identify the kind of leave being taken.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dynamic Calendar Layout:</strong> The grid covers a full year of working days, automatically adjusting the layout to display a comprehensive view of leave schedules.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive and Easy to Use:</strong> The user interface is built with an intuitive, spreadsheet-like view, enabling simple scrolling, filtering, and data viewing.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    When the application starts, it connects to the company’s database to retrieve employee records and their leave data. It then processes this information to generate a calendar grid where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each row represents an individual employee.</li>
    <li>Each column (beyond the initial columns for names and companies) represents a specific day, with workdays highlighted for easier visibility.</li>
    <li>Leave entries are placed in the corresponding day’s cell, and the cell’s background color indicates the type of leave.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>User Instructions</h2>
  <div class="instructions">
    <h3>For Managers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Viewing Data:</strong> When you open the application, the leave calendar is automatically populated with the most recent data. Scroll horizontally to review leave details across the calendar.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifying Leave Types:</strong> Notice that cells are color-coded according to the type of leave. This visual cue helps in quickly identifying patterns or specific types of leave (e.g., annual, sick leave).</li>
      <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> The application includes basic filtering options to help you sort the list by employee name or company if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Exiting the Application:</strong> To close the application, simply click the "Close" button provided at the bottom of the interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These instructions are intended to make it straightforward to understand how the leave calendar works and how to use it for effective staff management.
